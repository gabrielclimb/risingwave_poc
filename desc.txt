Create a FastStream application which will retrieve the current cryptocurrency
price and publish it to new_crypto_price topic. 

The application should retrieve the data every 2 seconds.

A message which will be produced is JSON with the two attributes:
- price: non-negative float (current price of cryptocurrency in USD)
- crypto_currency: string (the cryptocurrency e.g. BTC, ETH...)

The current price of Bitcoin can be retrieved by a simple GET request to:
    - https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot

The current price of Ethereum can be retrieved by a simple GET request to:
    - https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/ETH-USD/spot

The response of this GET request is a JSON and you can get information about
the crypto_currency in:
    response['data']['base']

and the information about the price in:
    response['data']['amount']

Use utf-8 encoded crypto_currency attribute as a partition key when publishing
the message to new_crypto_price topic.
